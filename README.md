simpleRedisRealTimeApplication
This is a simple real-time messaging application that demonstrates how to use Redis, Express.js, and Socket.IO to enable real-time communication between two separate backend and frontend instances.

🧩 Architecture
The communication flow is as follows:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Frontend1 → Backend1 → Redis Pub/Sub → Backend2 → Frontend2
This simulates a distributed system where two independent servers exchange real-time messages via Redis.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simpleRedisRealTimeApplication.git
   cd simpleRedisRealTimeApplication
2. Install Dependencies
   Make sure you have Node.js and Redis installed.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install 3. Start Redis Server
Start your Redis server (ensure it's running on the default port 6379):

bash
Copy
Edit
redis-server 4. Start the Backends
In two separate terminal windows:

Start Backend 1:

bash
Copy
Edit
node index.js
Start Backend 2:

bash
Copy
Edit
node index2.js 5. Open the Frontends
Open the HTML files in your browser (you can use Live Server or serve them with a static file server):

Open index.html (Frontend 1)

Open index2.html (Frontend 2)

💬 How It Works
Frontend 1 sends a message via Socket.IO to Backend 1.

Backend 1 publishes the message to Redis.

Backend 2, subscribed to the Redis channel, receives the message.

Backend 2 emits the message to Frontend 2 via Socket.IO.

This demonstrates a pub/sub messaging pattern using Redis, allowing communication between decoupled servers.

🔧 Configuration
Redis must be running and accessible to both backend instances.

By default, the servers listen on:

index.js → port 3000

index2.js → port 4000

Make sure these ports are not blocked or in use by other services.

📦 Dependencies
Express.js

Socket.IO

Redis (node-redis)
